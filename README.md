## How to use

#### Only activates with .js and .ts files

* Inside where you are declaring rtl queries, press `Cmd+Shift+B` (Mac), or `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows)
* The output will be a comma and a debug, and (on a new line) a debug that's called. `debug();`

#### Keyboard Shortcut
By default the keyboard shortcut is `Cmd+Shift+B` or `Ctrl+Shift+B`

Press `Cmd+P` or `Ctrl+P` and type in `Open Keyboard Shortcuts`.
Search for `Log Javascript Selection` and click on the `pen icon`.
This is where you can enter any `Shortcut` you choose.
